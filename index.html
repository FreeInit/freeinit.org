    <p>FreeInit.org is the community initiative in support of free and open-source alternatives to the X Desktop Group's
      <i>systemd</i> init system and middleware suite.
    </p>

    <p>FreeInit.org is not an init system itself; it is a movement in support of projects aiming to build alternatives
      to systemd's init system and other systemd components.</p>

    <p>Our initial goals are:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Creating a list of systemd components</b>, the FOSS alternatives to these, and the status and
        systemd-compatibility of these alternatives.
        <br />It will serve as a helpful resource both to users and interested developers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creating a <i>libsystemd</i> implementation</b> providing the various utility libraries (e.g.
        libsystemd-bus), and
        with init, journal, and login management functionality abstracted so that it may work with alternatives.
        <br />This will unify the disparate <i>libsystemd</i> implementations of e.g. Basu and elogind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Promoting the uptake of seatd/libseat</b>, respectively a seat-management daemon and a library
        providing an abstract interface backed by either seatd or systemd-logind/elogind.
        <br />Direct dependency on the systemd-logind interface would thereby be minimised.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Building solidarity</b> between those who think free software is more than just a buzzword.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>The FreeInit.org initiative is young and any support is welcomed. If you are interested, please visit <a
        href=https://github.com/FreeInit/freeinit.org>our GitHub
        repository</a> and create an issue.</p>

    <p>Our members projects include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/InitWare/InitWare">InitWare</a>: A fork of systemd's init system aiming for
        modularity, portability to BSD, and reduced project scope.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/sharpsuite/sharpinit">SharpInit</a>: A modular, high-performance init daemon in
        C#.</li>
    </ul>
