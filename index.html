    <p>FreeInit.org is the community initiative in support of free and open-source alternatives to the X Desktop Group's
      <i>systemd</i> init system and middleware suite.
    </p>

    <p>The purpose of the FreeInit.org initiative is not to build an alternative to the init system part of systemd; it
      is instead to act in support of projects aiming to build alternatives to systemd more broadly, now that systemd
      means much more than an init system.</p>

    <p>Our initial goals are:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Creating a list of systemd components</b>, the FOSS alternatives to these, and the status and
        systemd-compatibility of these alternatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Creating a <i>libsystemd</i> implementation</b> providing the various utility libraries (e.g.
        libsystemd-bus), and
        with init, journal, and login management functionality abstracted so that it may work with alternatives.
        <br />This will unify the disparate <i>libsystemd</i> implementations of e.g. Basu and elogind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Promoting the uptake of seatd/libseat</b>, respectively a seat-management daemon and a library
        providing an
        abstract interface backed by either seatd or systemd-logind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Building solidarity</b> between those who think free software is more than just a buzzword.
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
